# Pluralsight EF Core 6 Fundamentals  
All code samples for [EF Core 6 Fundamentals on Pluralsight](https://pluralsight.pxf.io/EFCore6)  
Published May 3, 2022  

Samples are organized by module with before and after versions. The last 3 modules (14, 15, 16) don't have before and after. They just have solutions that were discussed in those modules.

Solutions were built using Visual studio 2022 on Windows and using SQL Server LocalDb.

There are two branches. EFCore6 (original in course) and EFCore7.

The EF Core 7 branch is still using .NET6 but every solution (before and after) has been updated to target EF Core 7.

The demos for Modules 2-10 required NO CHANGES AT ALL.
